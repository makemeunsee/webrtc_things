        <h1>webrtc_things</h1>

<p>Tests and demos with and around webrtc.</p>

<p>Note: all these demos require Firefox Nightly or Chrome Canary, and interop is not yet achieved.</p>

<h2>main.css &amp; webrtc_common.js &amp; adapter.js</h2>

<p>Common files required by the demos.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/webrtc-samples/source/browse/trunk/apprtc/js/adapter.js">adapter.js source</a>, available under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">new BSD license</a></p>

<h2>webrtc.html &amp; webrtc_standalone.js</h2>

<p>A standalone demo of 2 way communication using webrtc inside the same page.</p>

<h2>webrtc_manual_handshake.html &amp; webrtc_manual.js</h2>

<p>A failed demo of webrtc communication initiated without broker, by copying and pasting the handshake through another mean (up to the users: IM, email, etc.). The current timeout (~3sec) to conclude the handshake is preventing this to work, but maybe later it could be configured or specified somehow.</p>

<h2>webrtc_websocket_broker.html &amp; webrtc_websocket_broker.js</h2>

<p>A demo of webrtc communication initiated with a minimalist websocket broker (see broker-src).<br>
Intended to be provided from the broker homepage, but can be easily deployed elsewhere by setting up properly the broker uri.<br>
Interop between Nightly and Canary not yet successful, as the datachannel fails to open between the 2 browsers.</p>

<h2>webrtc_peer_handshake.html &amp; webrtc_peer_handshake.js</h2>

<p>Based on the previous demo, users join a network and can get in touch through the broker, but a peer handshaking is available too.<br>
For this to work, a user A must be in contact with both B and C, and B and C must not be in contact already. A can then use the 'Go between' tool to intermediate between B and C.<br>
For simplicity reasons, it was not implemented that B and C are able to refuse being put in contact.<br>
Canary is not supported, due to its current limit imposed on the size of messages exchanged through a datachannel. It could be bypassed by using a more complex protocol between peers and splitting messages.</p>

<h2>broker-src</h2>

<p>Java code for a websocket Jetty servlet. Serves as broker for some of the previous demos.</p>

<p>Short attempt to describe the broker protocol:</p>

<ul>
<li>Peers connect using websocket to the broker.</li>
<li>Peers join ('join_[networkid]_[nick]') a network of their choice, pick a nick or none to remain invisible.</li>
<li>The broker sends joining peers a list of all visible peers in the network.</li>
<li>Peers can request contact ('can i friend_[peerId]') with another peer to the broker.</li>
<li>The broker transmit the request to the interested party ('wanna be friend_[requesterId]').</li>
<li>Requested peer can refuse the contact ('no friend_[requesterId]') or accept and initiate a webRTC peer connection through the broker.</li>
<li>Upon refusal, the requesting peer is not sent any special message.</li>
</ul><p>The broker in fact transmits automatically offers and answers of webRTC peer connection from any to any peer inside a network, the choice is left to the client code to accept the webRTC connection or not.<br>
Here the client and server support a simple social protocol, allowing users to choose when to create the connection or not.</p>
